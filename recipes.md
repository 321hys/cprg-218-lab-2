### Lemon Tart

Ingredients :
FOR THE CRUST:
- 1 c. all-purpose flour
- 2 1/2 tbsp. granulated sugar
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 6 tbsp. cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
- 1 large egg yolk
- 4 tsp. ice water
FOR THE FILLING:
- 1 1/4 c. granulated sugar
- 1/3 c. cornstarch
- 2 tbsp. all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
- 5 large egg yolks
- 1/4 c. unsalted butter
- 1/4 c. fresh lemon juice (from two lemons)
- 1 tbsp. lemon zest
FOR THE TOPPING:
- 1 1/4 c. heavy cream
- 2 tbsp. granulated sugar
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- Fresh berries (optional)

Instructions:
1. For the crust: Whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. With a pastry cutter or your fingers, gradually work the butter into the flour until pea-sized pieces form. Stir together the egg yolk and water in a small bowl, then stir into the flour mixture using a fork. Stir, then knead the dough together until it is no longer crumbly and holds together when pinched with your fingers. Form it into a disc and wrap it tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 3 days.

2. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 11-inch circle. Transfer the crust to a 9-inch round fluted tart pan with a removable bottom. Press the crust into the pan and trim the edges. Place the crust in the refrigerator for 60 minutes (or freezer for 30 minutes).

3. Preheat the oven to 400˚ during the last 20 minutes of chilling the crust. Line the inside of the crust with parchment paper, then fill with baking weights or dried beans. Bake until the edges of the crust are very lightly golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the pie weights and parchment paper, and prick the bottom of the crust with a fork, 6 to 8 times. Return to the oven and bake until the whole crust is golden brown all over, 8 to 12 minutes longer. Let cool to room temperature.

4. For the filling: Whisk together the sugar, cornstarch, flour, and salt in a medium saucepan. Gradually whisk in 1 1/2 cups cold water until smooth. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture boils, about 5 minutes. Boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly, then remove from the heat.

5. Whisk the egg yolks in a small bowl. While whisking, slowly add 1/4 cup of the hot sugar mixture into the egg yolks. Gradually stir the yolk mixture from the bowl back into the remaining sugar mixture in the saucepan. Return to medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until a thermometer reads 160˚to 180˚, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and immediately stir in the butter, lemon juice and zest, until the butter is completely melted. Pour the filling into the cooled tart crust. Let it cool for 15 minutes. Press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface of the filling, then refrigerate for 4 hours.

6. For the topping: Whisk together the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Spread whipped cream over top of chilled pie. Garnish with fresh berries, if you like.

###Lemon cookies

Ingredients

- 1 cup white sugar

- ½ cup butter, softened

- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon zest

- 2 large eggs

- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour

- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder

- ¼ teaspoon salt

- ¼ cup confectioners' sugar for rolling

Directions
1. Beat together sugar, butter, and lemon zest in a large bowl using an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Whisk together eggs, lemon juice, and vanilla in a small bowl until combined. Beat into butter mixture slowly on low speed.

2. Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Add to egg mixture slowly on low speed until just combined. Do not overbeat; dough will be sticky. Cover and chill dough in the refrigerator for 30 minutes; it will still be sticky after chilling.

3. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

4. Form dough into balls using a cookie scoop or tablespoon, then roll each in confectioners' sugar. Place 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Lightly smash each ball down using your hand.

5. Bake in the preheated oven until the centers are just barely set, 11 to 12 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack completely before storing in an airtight container.
